# Tutorials / Scripts for Interfacing with Aeroval

This repo contains a number of scripts which illustrate how to interface with the [Aeroval](https://aeroval.met.no/) API.

Currently the scripts cover the following:

- `site-data.py`: How to extract site / station data, and cross-referencing it with EBAS to get additional meta-data.
- `map-scatter.py`: How to get the map and scatter data for an Aeroval selection.
